# MadarTheGraduationProject
The goal of this project is to provide a game that will teach astronomy to children between the age of (9-12) years using augmented reality.
# Introduction

How far is it to the moon from earth? The sun? the stars? What actually are all these mistress space concepts? all these questions can be answered by studying astronomy which is the study of the sun, moon, stars, and other non-Earthly bodies and phenomena [1].

The goal of this project is to provide a game that will teach astronomy to children between the age of (9-12) years old in the most interactive and fun matter where the child will live and play live as an astronaut. The reason why it is important to introduce children to astronomy, is because the establishment of The Saudi Space Commission December 2018. It states that it focuses on providing &quot;a bold step that serves a future that is innovative and looks forward to the latest technologies and opportunities in the Saudi Space Industry&quot; [2]. As we know, 2030 vision&#39;s main focus is to improve our country and has considered the astronomy field as one of the important fields worth investing in [3].

Today most of the people are fairly confident that the Milky Way is probably between 100,000 and 150,000 light-years across. The observable universe is, of course, much larger [4]. Compared to how the space is big we know just little especially children here in Saudi Arabia because the lack of knowledge that is introduced to them in school or even the summer camp it almost like there is no big attention for astronomy.

To solve this lack of attention on astronomy, we want to bring the children&#39;s eyes to astronomy so no matter how far away the moon is we aim to bring it to children by utilizing the technology of Augmented reality. Where the Augmented reality provides an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information [5]. By benefit Augmented reality, these mistress space concepts will be easy to understand and fun to play with at the same time.

The game will have different levels. These levels will start with teaching the children some basic knowledge that they need to understand astronomy like gravity from physics, gases from chemistry and more topics that are necessary for advanced levels in the game where the levels will be only focusing on astronomy.

# Project Objectives

In this project, we aim to develop an application to:

    - Introduce children to astronomy.
    - Teach children some astronomy topics.
    - Give children fun learning experiences with Augmented reality.
